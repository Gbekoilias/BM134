<h1 align = 'center'> Strategy In Action - Readme </h1>
<h2 align = 'center'> Overview </h2>
This section outlines a step-by-step algorithm for writing the "Strategy In Action" part of the assessment, aiming for a 600-word count. It involves the formulation of key considerations for the implementation roadmap of recommended strategies, considering key configuration, change context, and type. This should be backed by critical evaluation of relevant concepts, theories, frameworks, tools, and models, along with persuasive argumentation supported by appropriate referencing.

## 1. Introduction (Approx. 80 words)
    Briefly introduce the significance of implementing the recommended strategies. Emphasize the importance of considering key configuration, change context, and type in formulating the implementation roadmap.

## 2. Justification of Framework/Tool Choice (Approx. 100 words)
    Justify the choice of the framework/tool for formulating the implementation roadmap. Explain its relevance to the organization's context and change requirements. Link it back to the strategic choices made earlier.

## 3. Key Considerations for Implementation (Approx. 150 words)
    Outline the key considerations for the implementation roadmap, focusing on aspects like configuration, change context, and type. Reference relevant concepts, theories, and models to support your analysis.

## 4. Application and Analysis (Approx. 150 words)
    Apply the chosen framework/tool to the formulation of the implementation roadmap. Analyze how the recommended strategies align with key considerations. Provide evidence-backed arguments and critical evaluation.

## 5. Discussion on Shortcomings (Approx. 80 words)
    Discuss any limitations or shortcomings of the approach taken in formulating the implementation roadmap. Acknowledge challenges and provide insights into potential mitigations.

## 6. Conclusion (Approx. 20 words)
    Summarize the key considerations for the implementation of recommended strategies. Highlight their importance for successful execution.

## 7. Formatting and References (Remaining words)
    Ensure proper formatting per assessment guidelines. Include a reference list with appropriate citations.
