External Analysis
Description: An analysis of the focal organisation’s external
			environment, (e.g., the macro-environment,
			strategy, and/ or market), backed by critical
			evaluation of relevant concepts, theories,
			frameworks, tools and models and persuasive
			argumentation (supported by appropriate
			referencing).

Evaluation (Requirements): Outstanding, well-supported, evidence-backed
						application and analysis, supported by critical
						evaluation of relevant concepts, theories,
						frameworks, tools and models and persuasive
						argumentation and appropriate referencing,
						and well-argued reasons for the choice of
						framework(s)/ tool(s), and discussion on the
						shortcomings of the approach.


At SCQF Level 11, mere “description”, “comprehension” or simple “understanding” are not
sufficient. Students are expected to demonstrate higher-level skills - see Bloom's taxonomy
Hence, please do not expend too much time, effort or word count into describing the
frameworks and tools. Your understanding should shine through your application and critical
analysis.
Specifically, you'd start with justifying why a certain framework, model or tool is appropriate to
use in your particular organisation and situation, then you'd spend most of your time and effort
into the application, and finally you'd wrap up with a discussion around the limitations of that
particular approach.
