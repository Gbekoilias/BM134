Recommendations from the PESTLE/PESTEL Analysis
This PESTEL analysis of Microsoft Corporation highlights a variety of opportunities that can boost the company’s growth and expansion in the global computer hardware, software, consumer electronics, and online services market. 
The remote or macro-environment is advantageous to the business, considering the opportunities available to Microsoft in markets worldwide. However, this PESTEL analysis shows that the main threat against the company is competition based on the expansion of foreign firms, as indicated through the external factor of increasing international trade agreements. 
Microsoft experiences rising competitive rivalry with software firms. To address this threat, a recommendation is for the company to develop innovative and novel software products that can outcompete their rivals. It is also recommended that Microsoft develop additional strategic alliances with other firms to increase its competitive strength in overseas markets.
As identified in this external analysis through the PESTEL/PESTLE analysis model, the opportunities in the industry environment should be adequate for Microsoft to continue as one of the major firms in the global information technology and online services industry.

CONCLUSION
After the careful study of the pestle analysis of Microsoft, we have concluded that the brand has a top position in the software industry across the world. But macro-environmental factors are out of the control of any business. It doesn’t matter however large the brand may be.
Therefore, the company should maintain a less gender discriminate environment inside the organization. If Microsoft doesn’t change its course of action, then anti-trust and other lawsuits would send a negative image of the company.

Recommendation fro the VIRO Analysis
Artificial intelligence is part of Microsoft Corporation’s ongoing strategic plans to grow the business and establish its presence as a leading AI provider. However, as shown in the VRIO table, AI capabilities are still a non-core competency because the company’s focus remains on computing hardware, software, and related cloud-based or online services.
Nonetheless, Microsoft has the opportunity to make AI a core competency for competing against the AI offerings of other firms. This shift is possible by further building the business organization to support AI development and to offer AI services. In addition, this VRIO analysis of Microsoft Corporation presents the growing portfolio of products for other platforms, which has the potential to become a core competency. 
Further expanding the portfolio can increase the company’s market reach and brand recall. Such strategic expansion of the product portfolio can increase Microsoft’s competitiveness based on network externalities, product compatibility, and customer convenience.
