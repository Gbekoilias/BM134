Microsoft PESTLE/PESTEL Analysis – Recommendations
This PESTEL analysis of Microsoft Corporation highlights a variety of opportunities that can boost the company’s growth and expansion in the global computer hardware, software, consumer electronics, and online services market. 
The remote or macro-environment is advantageous to the business, considering the opportunities available to Microsoft in markets worldwide. However, this PESTEL analysis shows that the main threat against the company is competition based on the expansion of foreign firms, as indicated through the external factor of increasing international trade agreements. 
Microsoft experiences rising competitive rivalry with software firms. To address this threat, a recommendation is for the company to develop innovative and novel software products that can outcompete their rivals. It is also recommended that Microsoft develop additional strategic alliances with other firms to increase its competitive strength in overseas markets.
As identified in this external analysis through the PESTEL/PESTLE analysis model, the opportunities in the industry environment should be adequate for Microsoft to continue as one of the major firms in the global information technology and online services industry.

CONCLUSION
After the careful study of the pestle analysis of Microsoft, we have concluded that the brand has a top position in the software industry across the world. But macro-environmental factors are out of the control of any business. It doesn’t matter however large the brand may be.
Therefore, the company should maintain a less gender discriminate environment inside the organization. If Microsoft doesn’t change its course of action, then anti-trust and other lawsuits would send a negative image of the company.
