Three states of the external organizational environment — controllable, partially controllable and uncontrollable — are identified, and the information characteristics of each state are discussed. The approaches that organizations can adopt to collect information on the environment are also discussed; these approaches use externally-based data sources and modeling and/or analytic techniques. On these bases, we consider effective strategies and methodologies which organizations can adopt for processing, evaluating and communicating information about the external environment to satisfy decision-making requirements.","1981-01-01","2024-02-18 15:22:07","2024-02-18 15:22:07","2024-02-18 15:22:07","301-316","","4","6","","Accounting, Organizations and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\KADMW4KI\0361368281900106.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on the so called environment-poverty nexus where issues of environmental conservation and management meet the social and economic development needs. Given the threats to the global environment and the forces of economic development that work against it, it is crucial that environmental policies, strategies, programmes and projects are designed and implemented in an effective manner producing lasting impacts. Evaluation is a central tool for analysing what works, why and under what circumstances to inform policy making and programme design. Environmental evaluation faces specific challenges due to the complex nature of the environment-poverty nexus. Based on a review of evaluation literature and practical experiences with evaluations conducted on the nexus in the international development arena, the article draws lessons for evaluating sustainable development. It concludes by suggesting that strong evaluation be built into the new Sustainable Development Goals.","2016","2024-02-18 15:26:44","2024-02-18 15:26:44","2024-02-18 15:26:44","441-447","","3","7","","","The Environment-poverty Nexus in Evaluation","","","","","","","en","© 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12347","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\KCGWUT8B\1758-5899.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the issue has been extensively studied at the conceptual level, in practice few empirical studies include an explicit analysis that is directed toward externally valid inferences. In this article, we make three contributions to improve empirical approaches for external validity. First, we propose a formal framework that encompasses four dimensions of external validity: -, -, -, and C-validity (populations, treatments, outcomes, and contexts). The proposed framework synthesizes diverse external validity concerns. We then distinguish two goals of generalization. To conduct effect-generalization—generalizing the magnitude of causal effects—we introduce three estimators of the target population causal effects. For sign-generalization—generalizing the direction of causal effects—we propose a novel multiple-testing procedure under weaker assumptions. We illustrate our methods through field, survey, and lab experiments as well as observational studies.","2023-08","2024-02-18 15:26:50","2024-02-18 15:26:50","2024-02-18 15:26:50","1070-1088","","3","117","","","Elements of External Validity","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\L2LM3TZ3\Egami and Hartman - 2023 - Elements of External Validity Framework, Design, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the evaluation of environmental and climate impact involves too many parameters, some of which are indirect and hidden, it is very hard to make rationale analysis without the support of a holistic strategic analysis framework. In this paper, we propose to extend the goal-oriented requirements modeling language, GRL, to model the rationality behind IT system design, in particular, how the environment related considerations come into play in such design decision making.

It highlights how the continent's increasing adoption of innovative technologies, such as renewable energy solutions and digital infrastructure, coupled with well-crafted strategic policies and international collaborations, is transforming various sectors and fostering a sustainable future. These advancements have not only improved access to basic services like healthcare and education but have also created new opportunities for economic growth and job creation. The paper emphasizes the importance of ongoing collaborations between African countries and international partners in sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources to accelerate sustainable development efforts across the continent. The paper discusses different international organizations that have collaborated with and assisted Africa in the areas of technical innovation, finance, and knowledge exchange necessary to achieve a full-scale sustainable future. Despite their humanitarian efforts, Africa faces tremendous hurdles in attaining a sustainable future. These challenges range from a lack of access to technology and digital infrastructure in rural areas to difficulties in harnessing technological advancements due to infrastructure and connectivity constraints. These challenges have hindered Africa's ability to fully leverage the potential of technical innovation and digital solutions for a sustainable future. Limited financial resources and investment opportunities have further impeded progress in achieving the necessary infrastructure and connectivity upgrades.

Following recent interest in the use of strategy tools, the purpose of this paper is to focus on what happens when VRIO informs strategy action. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses experimental method to evaluate directly users’ analysis guided by VRIO relative to analysis that is not. Systematic coding of the responses evaluates how users select resources to evaluate, in which areas they make recommendations, and what account they take of competitors, dynamic evolution, and resource disadvantages, risks and limitations. Findings VRIO encouraged users to evaluate resources relative to competitors and competitive dynamics, but resource selection difficulties and failure to evaluate resource disadvantages limited its value. In addition, it drew users to the existing operations and business model. Research limitations/implications The study highlights a tendency for users to evaluate antecedents and outcomes of resources, and partly supports the view that VRIO elicits inward-looking descriptions. Field-based research is needed to show how using VRIO plays out in full strategy making context. Practical implications Highlighted limitations in VRIO analysis could be alleviated by better specifying resource selection and by addressing the positive-only tenor of VRIO materials.

First, we assess how the predictions of theVRIO-framework contrast with decisions based on “gut feeling” using the forecasts derived from a recognition-based decision making tool, theRecognition Heuristic. Secondly, theVRIO-framework’spredictive power is compared to predictions derived fromAnalyst Ratings.

Less attention has been given to the factors driving the growth of the technological innovators themselves. This paper examines the case of one of the central contributors to the IT revolution, the Microsoft Corporation. The company's sources of growth are estimated using the conventional Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches ""residual"" model, expanded to include investments in product research and development, sales and marketing, and organizational development (collectively termed the company's ""intangible"" capital). The picture of Microsoft that emerges from this analysis is a story about the successful use of knowledge inputs to produce knowledge outputs. It is also a story of the importance of product innovation, rather than process innovation, as a source of total factor productivity growth. The theoretical underpinnings of the empirical analysis are also examined, and a model is sketched in which the neoclassical growth accounting framework is linked to the theoretically messier world of the Schumpeterian competitor via the Berndt-Fuss theorem on capital utilization.","2010-03","2024-02-18 15:54:47","2024-02-18 15:54:47","2024-02-18 15:54:47","","","","","","","Decoding Microsoft","Working Paper Series","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w15799","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\D35XZH7Y\Hulten - 2010 - Decoding Microsoft Intangible Capital as a Source.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15799","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"R36U5EBF","journalArticle","2015","Khan, Razib","The Use of Real Option Analysis (ROA) to assist in Security Solution Decisions","","","","","","Security management, security risk management and security service evaluation involve deciding on a security strategy and an appropriate set of security solutions to align with the strategy. However, as there are limited budget, time and resources available to identify, select, employ, monitor, review and maintain the set of security solutions, multiple perspectives must be taken into consideration in the decision making process. One important factor for constructing effective security solution decision is to make the decision dynamic. The nature of security risk changes day by day. As time passes old risks may go away and new risks may arise. So it is necessary to make the security decision in such a way that it can keep pace with the frequently changing security risks. The security solution decision must be satisfied with the demand of changing circumstances due to changing in time and changing in technologies so that decision maker can maintain an acceptable risk level and demolish the undesirable effect of uncertainty by providing improved risk assessment and management activities. Real Option Analysis (ROA) can be seen as a promising alternative to offer effective and dynamic security solution decision making process. It offers possibilities to improve decision making in security solution decision. This paper investigates how ROA could be used to assist in security solution decisions by integrating ROA with Security Decision Making Process (SDMP) which facilitates any organization to achieve better business continuity plan. Later the framework is tested through a simulation example. Real option thinking has been applied to several software designs and engineering concepts, such as eXtreme Programming (XP), COTS-based development, project investment analysis, decision making in software prototyping and strategic software reuse. Comparing with the software engineering issues, planning a security solution decision through ROA includes more uncertainties.","2015-11-22","2024-02-18 16:00:50","2024-02-18 16:00:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\6TC4F5I2\Khan - 2015 - The Use of Real Option Analysis (ROA) to assist in.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Razib-Khan-3/publication/267995079_The_Use_of_Real_Option_Analysis_ROA_to_assist_in_Security_Solution_Decisions/links/5570679e08ae193af41ff67c/The-Use-of-Real-Option-Analysis-ROA-to-assist-in-Security-Solution-Decisions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide answers to these important and urgent questions, MIT Sloan School of Management Professor Michael Cusumano draws on nearly 30 years of research into the practices of global corporations that have been acknowledged leaders and benchmark setters - and Microsoft, Apple, Intel, Google, and others in software, internet services, and consumer electronics, and Toyota in manufacturing. If we look deeply enough, he contends, we can see the ideas that underpin the management practices that make for great companies, and drive their strategic evolution and innovation capabilities. From his deep knowledge of these organizations, Cusumano distils six enduring principles that he believes have been - in various combinations - crucial to their strategy, innovation management practices, and ability to deal with change and uncertainty. The first two principles - platforms (not just products), and services, for product firms - are relatively new and broader ways of thinking about strategy and business models, based on Cusumano's latest research. The other four - capabilities (not just strategy), the ""pull"" concept, economies of scope, and flexibility (not just efficiency) - all contribute to agility, which is a mix of flexibility and speed. Some practices associated with these ideas, such as dynamic capabilities, just-in-time production, iterative or prototype-driven product development, flexible design and manufacturing, modular architectures, and component reuse, are now commonly regarded as standard best practices. They are also essential to a new world dominated by platforms and technology-enabled services.","2010-09-16","2024-02-18 16:02:57","2024-02-18 16:02:57","","","388","","","","","Staying Power","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: LZ4SDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=LZ4SDAAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Corporate & Business History; Business & Economics / General; Business & Economics / Management; Business & Economics / New Business Enterprises; Business & Economics / Production & Operations Management; Business & Economics / Strategic Planning; Technology & Engineering / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the case study of Kindle 2, the study reveals the need to align innovative products and services with a company's overall brand strategy to avoid dilution. Finally, it suggests that a mobile business model based on a proprietary approach can be successful in the short run, its long run success depends on the ability to react to new market requirements and competitors.

Based on 126,312 articles from 323 Scopus subfields in 2012, the optimal strategy to find articles with DOIs is to search for them by title and filter out those with incorrect DOIs. This finds 90% of journal articles. For articles without DOIs, the optimal strategy is to search for them by title and then filter out matches with dissimilar metadata. This finds 89% of journal articles, with an additional 1% incorrect matches. The remaining articles seem to be mainly not indexed by Microsoft Academic or indexed with a different language version of their title. From the matches, Scopus citation counts and Microsoft Academic counts have an average Spearman correlation of 0.95, with the lowest for any single field being 0.63.

Its main objective is to examine the relationship between “strategic orientation” and “firm performance”, in the light of two firm-specific factors (“distinct manufacturing capabilities” and “organisational structure”). The proposed research model of the present study is built upon the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the organisational aspect of the VRIO framework (the “O” from the VRIO model). Design/methodology/approach The study proposes a newly developed research model that adopts a four-factor approach, while examining a number of direct and indirect effects. The examination of the proposed research model was made with the use of a newly developed structured questionnaire that was distributed on a sample of Greek manufacturing companies. Research hypotheses were tested using the structural equation modelling technique. The present study is explanatory (examines cause and effect relationships), deductive (tests research hypotheses), empirical (collects primary data) and quantitative (analyses quantitative data that were collected using a structured questionnaire). Findings The empirical results suggest the coexistence of three distinct categories of effects on “firm performance”: strategy or “utility” effects, depending on the content of the implemented strategy; firm-specific effects, depending on the content of the organisational resources and capabilities; and organisational effects, depending on the implemented organisational structure. More specifically, the statistical analysis underlines the significant mediating role of “strategic orientation” and the complementary role of “organisational structure”. Finally, empirical results support the argument that “strategy follows structure”. Research limitations/implications The use of self-reported scales constitutes an inherent methodological limitation. Moreover, the present study lacks a longitudinal approach because it provides a static picture of the subject under consideration. Finally, the sample size of 130 manufacturing companies could raise some concerns. Despite that, previous empirical studies of the same field, published in respectable journals, were also based on similar samples. Practical implications When examining the total (direct and indirect) effects on “firm performance”, it seems that the effect of “organisational structure” is, almost, identical to the effect of “distinct manufacturing capabilities”. This implies that “organisational structure” (an imitable capability) has, almost, the same contribution on “firm performance” as the manufacturing capabilities of the organisation (an inimitable capability). Thus, the practical significance of “organisational structure” is being highlighted. Originality/value There has been little empirical research concerning the bundle of firm-specific factors that enhance the impact of strategy on business performance. Under the context of the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, the present study examines the impact of “organisational structure” on the “strategy-capabilities-performance” relationship, something that has not been thoroughly investigated in the strategic management literature. Also, the present study proposes an alternate measure for capturing the concept of business strategy, the so-called factor of “strategic orientation”. Finally, the study adopts a “reversed view” in the relationship between structure and strategy. More specifically, it postulates that “strategy follows structure” and not the opposite (“structure follows strategy”). Actually, the empirical data supported that (reversed) view, challenging the traditional approach of Chandler (1962) and calling for additional research on that ongoing dispute.","2018-01-01","2024-02-18 16:22:57","2024-02-18 16:22:57","2024-02-18 16:22:57","46-73","","1","41","","","The role of firm-specific factors in the strategy-performance relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\BRRLR5BA\html.html","","","Business strategy; Firm performance; Greece; Organizational capabilities; Organizational structure; Strategic management and leadership; Strategic orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pattern of results thus can provide useful information concerning the proper execution of the underlying strategy (i.e., the performance evaluation role) and the strength of the cause-and-effect linkages assumed by the strategy (i.e., the strategy evaluation role). Unfortunately, managers’ tendency to re-examine strategy when divisional performance falls short of target is relatively low in practice (Campbell et al. 2008; Ittner and Larcker 2005). Possible explanations include attribution error (i.e., the tendency to attribute poor financial results to poor subordinate performance rather than to strategic factors) and construal error (i.e. the tendency to focus on specific individual performance metrics instead of the overall pattern of results presented in a complicated SPMS) (Koonce et al. 2011). We experimentally examine two decision aids designed to help strategic business unit managers avoid attribution and construal errors. Results of our first experiment indicate that the decision aids, individually as well as interactively, increase managers’ tendency to re-examine strategy. We find consistent results in a second experiment that examines the effects of the two decision aids (when used together) on evaluators’ judgment under a different pattern of driver and outcome performance, and among a sample of more experienced managers.","2011-12-01","2024-02-18 16:22:59","2024-02-18 16:22:59","2024-02-18 16:22:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\S4KJBCRJ\Guo et al. - 2011 - Limiting the Effect of Attribution and Construal E.pdf","","","attribution error; mental construal; pattern recognition; strategic performance measurement system; Strategy evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1983501","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Management Accounting Research (MAR) constructed a special issue on SMA and concluded that (1) there were less than 20 key articles on this subject in the mainstream academic journals; (2) there was a lack of  comprehensive conceptual framework for SMA; and (3) there was limited empirical evidence. To explore this and related issues, a study of the relative significance of the use of cost information for strategic considerations in relation to two levels of competitive analysis - corporate competitive intelligent information, and business competitive intelligent information - was undertaken. The findings of the study relate managers’ perceptions of two dimensions of their environmental changes (stability and certainty) to the two levels of competitive analysis. In order to gain a wider understanding of this relationship, a random sample of 110 large Saudi companies were selected and data collected from senior managers. The results showed that (1) the perceptions of managers differ between their environmental certainty and stability; (2) the relative significance accorded to business competitive intelligent information was positively associated with rising instability; (3) the use of corporate competitive intelligent information was a common practice. An interpretation of the results is that market instability stimulates strategic movement and cost information is being used in management thinking to support strategic development in meeting competitive pressures and in restructuring and reconfiguration of business strategy.","2010-11-16","2024-02-18 16:23:02","2024-02-18 16:23:02","2024-02-18 16:23:02","","","6","26","","JABR","Strategic Choices","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c)","","","","clutejournals.com","","Number: 6","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\UP983FWB\AL-Hazmi - 2010 - Strategic Choices The Case Of Management Accounti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flexibility and robustness can be used to deal with future uncertainty. Real options analysis (ROA) provides a welfare-economics framework to design and evaluate robust and flexible FRM strategies under risk or uncertainty. Although its potential benefits are large, ROA is hardly used in todays' FRM practice. In this paper, we investigate benefits and limitations of a ROA, by applying it to a realistic FRM case study for an entire river branch. We illustrate how ROA identifies optimal short-term investments and values future options. We develop robust dike investment strategies and value the flexibility offered by additional room for the river measures. We benchmark the results of ROA against those of a standard cost-benefit analysis and show ROA's potential policy implications. The ROA for a realistic case requires a high level of geographical detail, a large ensemble of scenarios, and the inclusion of stakeholders' preferences. We found several limitations of applying the ROA. It is complex. In particular, relevant sources of uncertainty need to be recognized, quantified, integrated, and discretized in scenarios, requiring subjective choices and expert judgment. Decision trees have to be generated and stakeholders' preferences have to be translated into decision rules. On basis of this study, we give general recommendations to use high discharge scenarios for the design of measures with high fixed costs and few alternatives. Lower scenarios may be used when alternatives offer future flexibility.","2018-04","2024-02-18 16:23:30","2024-02-18 16:23:30","2024-02-18 16:23:29","3018-3036","","4","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","C:\Users\DONKAMS\Zotero\storage\IWFN5PRM\Kind et al. - 2018 - Benefits and Limitations of Real Options Analysis .pdf","","","adaptation; cost-benefit analysis; Delta Programme; flood risk management; real options analysis; room for the river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among many desirable outcomes, alliances can reduce costs, provide access to new technology, and improve research and development endeavours, though collaborative arrangements come with risks, peril, and adversities. This renewed and re-worked text connects theory to practice to help understand this important business practice. Strategic Alliance Management presents an academically grounded alliance development framework, detailing eight stages of alliance development with consideration for specific management challenges. For each stage, readers are presented with state-of-the-art theoretical insights, evidence-based managerial guidelines and a business case illustration. Additional chapters detail on contemporary alliance management challenges, including co-opetition and business eco-systems. Other chapters highlight the role of alliance professionals, alliance capabilities and paradoxical challenges in alliance relationships. This second edition retains a blend of academic knowledge and practical examples, while updating case examples and adding five new chapters on emerging alliance topics. This book remains vital reading for business students and professionals interested in strategic management.","2017-09-29","2024-02-18 17:39:25","2024-02-18 17:39:25","","","440","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4324/9781315543673","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be ""entangled"" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.","2019-05","2024-02-18 17:39:37","2024-02-18 17:39:37","2024-02-18 17:39:37","291-300","","","","","","Software Engineering for Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","artifical intelligence; Buildings; data; Data models; machine learning; Machine learning; Organizations; process; Software; software engineering; Software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
